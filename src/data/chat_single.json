However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n- According to the Development Projects Manual [p.2.53], cost estimates must be prepared with due care and diligence so that they only include necessary expenses. The term \"field monitoring vehicles\" may not be considered as a necessary expense without justification. - If monetization facilities have been availed by the officer(s) concerned, then using project vehicles is not an option [p.1]. This suggests that personal vehicles might not be funded through project funds. - Only limited operational vehicles according to the nature of the project would be considered for approval while considering existing resources [p.2].\n\n• The PD and staff will not be entitled to use project vehicles if the monetization facility  has been availed by the officer/s concerned.\n• Only limited  operational vehicl es, according to the nature of the project,  would be considered for  approval while considering the existing resources.\n• t and recurring side, along with their date of purchase, to \njustify the purchase of new vehicles.\n• Project Cost \n2.53 The cost estimates of a project must be prepared with due care and diligence so that these only [p.115, p.100, p.59]\n\nSources:\n[1] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.115\n[2] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.100\n[3] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.59</div>"

Just as a festival requires careful selection and definition of the event's theme, activities, and logistics before committing resources, PC-II is the stage where one project idea is chosen from several alternatives based on a need analysis [p.26]. In this phase, surveys and feasibility studies are conducted to provide full technical justification for undertaking the project [p.26]. This is similar to researching and planning various aspects of a festival such as location, audience capacity, entertainment options, and safety measures. Once the project idea is carefully developed, a project plan is prepared using the PC-I proforma, which can be likened to creating a detailed blueprint for the festival, outlining budget, timeline, and resources required [p.26].

The Development Projects Manual does not provide a direct limit on the number of vehicles that can be purchased with the project budget.

The Development Projects Manual does not mention any provisions for bypassing formal procedures or expediting approvals through informal means. Project approval processes are governed by the Development Proposal (DP) forms, specifically PC-I to PC-V. These forms require detailed feasibility studies, budget estimates, and other project information to be submitted for evaluation [p.10]. The approval thresholds and procedures for each form are as follows:\n\n• PC-I: Approval by the relevant department or agency\n• PC-II: Approval by the Development Working Party (DWP)\n• PC-III: Approval by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP)\n• ECNEC: Approval by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) for projects costing over Rs. 100M [p.45]\n\nIf the cost of a project exceeds 15% of the approved budget at the time the contract is being awarded, PC-I will be revised immediately and should be submitted for approval of the competent forum [p.1].\n\n• If the cost of the project exceeds 15% of the approved budget at the time the contract  is being awarded, PC-I will be revised immediately and should be submitted for approval  of the competent forum.

According to the provided context, if a project is identified as a national priority project located in more than one province or benefiting more than one province [p.10], or it costs over Rs. 100 billion [p.10], then it may be considered a core project.\n\nSource: Manual p.100–98\n\nSources:\n[1] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.100\n[2] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.96\n[3] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.98\n[4] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.101\n[5] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.183\n[6] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.78\n[7] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.79\n[8] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.188\n[9] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.76\n[10] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.151\n[11] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.101\n[12] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.137\n[13] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.106\n[14] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.175\n[15] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.98</div>"

    "content": "<div class='card success'>✅ <strong>Answer:</strong><br/>To update the PC-I when a project shifts from local funding to a mixed funding model (local + foreign), the sponsoring agency needs to provide a detailed justification for why the project cannot be implemented in the private sector or on a PPP basis [p.12]. The agency should also develop and present a financial plan of the project, including the sources of project funding in clear and specific terms [p.12-13].\n\nSource: Manual p.55–70\n\nSources:\n[1] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.55\n[2] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.55\n[3] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.96\n[4] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.70\n[5] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.56\n[6] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.57\n[7] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.57\n[8] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.146\n[9] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.117\n[10] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.145\n[11] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.99\n[12] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.61\n[13] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.71\n[14] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.72\n[15] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.27</div>"

Specifically, PC-II includes item-wise quantities and expenditures for revised projects, reasons for revision with justification, and information on any bottlenecks experienced during project execution and staffing issues (p.9).\n\nSource: Manual p.55–26\n\nSources:\n[1] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.55\n[2] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.27\n[3] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.26\n[4] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.27\n[5] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.70\n[6] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.99\n[7] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.73\n[8] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.72\n[9] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.27\n[10] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.146\n[11] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.131\n[12] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.152\n[13] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.77\n[14] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.99\n[15] Manual for Development Projects 2024, p.50</div>"
