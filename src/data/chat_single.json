    "content": "<div class='card success'>✅ <strong>Answer:</strong><br/>Sure! Here's an explanation of the difference between CDWP, ECNEC, and DDWP in terms of their project approval limits and composition based on the provided document. CDWP (Constituent Development Working Party) is a sub-committee of the Planning Commission responsible for advising the Central Government on development projects. The CDWP recommends projects to the ECNEC (Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet), which in turn approves or rejects them based on their feasibility, cost, and other relevant factors. ECNEC (Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet) is a high-level policy-making body that provides advice to the Prime Minister on economic matters. The ECNEC reviews and approves projects recommended by the CDWP, which are then submitted to the DDWP (Development Directorate Working Party) for implementation/execution.\n\n• Steps for  approval of projects from the DDWP/CDWP/ECNEC are explained and given in Annexure  10 to 12.\n• Beyond this cost threshold, the CDWP recommends projects to the ECNEC for  consideration and approval.\n• DDWP, PDWP, Special Areas DWP, CDWP and  ECNEC for implementation/execution of projects based on detailed design/estimates.\n• Secretariat of the PDWP and clearinghouse for the development  projects and programmes requiring approval of the CDW P and  ECNEC.\n• Beyond that limit projects will be submitted to  CDWP.

Here's an expanded version of the answer to the question provided in the given document, incorporating additional information and citations from the provided document:\n\nIn terms of ownership and transfer, there are three distinct modes of PPP (Build-Operate-Transfer, Build-Operate-Own, and Build-Operate-Outsource) that can occur under different circumstances. The first mode, known as BOT, involves the Private Party undertaking the financing and construction of an infrastructure project, while the Government acquires ownership through a contractual arrangement. This means that the Private Party retains control over the project's operations and maintenance for a set period after its completion. In contrast, BOO (Build-Operate-Outsource) involves the Private Party operating and maintaining the infrastructure project, while the Government transfers ownership to a third party for an agreed-upon period. This means that the Private Party retains control over operations and maintenance but relinquishes ownership to a third party.\n\n• SALIENT MODES OF PPP    2.25 PPPs can happen under different modes; however, the salient modes are presented in the table  below:  Table 5: Modes of PPP  Models Description  Build-and-Transfer (BT) A contractual arrangement in which the Private Party  undertakes the financing and construction of an  infrastructure project and after its completion hands it over to  the Government Agency.\n• (Refer to Chapter 2 for more details on PPPs).\n• Build -Operate -and -Transfer  (BOT)  A contractual arrangement in which the Private Party   undertakes the financing and construction of  an  infrastructure project, and the operation and  maintenance thereof.

    "content": "<div class='card success'>✅ <strong>Answer:</strong><br/>In summary, the \"throw-forward\" approach refers to the transfer of project assets and liabilities from one period to another in a planned manner. This is done by identifying and managing the assets and liabilities that are expected to be transferred during the project's life cycle. In contrast, the \"carry-over\" approach involves the continuation of these assets and liabilities after the project has been completed. In terms of financial planning, the throw-forward approach reflects a proactive approach to managing project assets and liabilities. This means that the project team identifies and manages the assets and liabilities in advance, allowing for a smooth transition from one period to another. The carry-over approach, on the other hand, is more reactive and involves continuing with the same assets and liabilities after the project has been completed.\n\n• The same applies to the disposal or transfer of the project assets.\n• 6.08 If the project is to be maintained after completion by another agency,  then both the agencies shall  coordinate in advance for the tr ansfer of project assets and liabilities with a proper inventory of handing  and taking over.

    "content": "<div class='card success'>✅ <strong>Answer:</strong><br/>Climate resilience is an essential component of project identification and formulaation (PC-II) in PC-I, as it helps to mitigate the impacts of climate change on a project's output specifications. The parameters for climate screening, including Climate Screening of projects through CHIRA, CARA, and CMA, are considered during the PC-I/PC-II stage. The negotiations during procurement stage are also taken into account to ensure that climate adaptation, mitigation, and co-benefits are embedded in the output specifications. The project's vulnerability to climate risk is evaluated by including climate resilience in evaluation criteria, so private sector proposals must include this aspect in their other technical reports. Including climate resilience in design and construction plans is also required during PC-I formulaation.
